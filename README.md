# NLSV2 2022 Addition! 

## Description 
Next Level Sports has been an idea of mine for years, this is my second attempt on buliding out the app, because like most new founders I overcomplicated the first version! 
**The goal** with this version of the app is to not only get it to the AppStore but to give you a clear indicator of where my skills are since most these projects are SUPER old.

## What is NLS
Next level sports is a stats app made for wrestling. Tenative features include, stats keeping, video recording & playback, and video comments. 

## What you'll see 
- You will see mostly complete test coverage! 
- A clearly outlined architecture in the app 
- How I approach building UI components

## Tentative Technologies
- Realm: For offline storage
- UIKit
- AVFoundation for video playback
